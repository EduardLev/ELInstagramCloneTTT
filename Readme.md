Turn To Tech Firebase & Photo Project

# Project Title

Images are loaded from Firebase Storage remotely, along with local data cache. Seamless scrolling for a large amount of images. Clicking on an image takes the user to a post, with a high quality version of the image, 'likes', and the ability to see existing comments as well as add additional comments in a UITableView below the image. Comments and likes persist with Firebase Database. User can delete their own posts, but not other users posts. Authorization, login and signup also available through Firebase Authorization. The user may also create a new post by taking a picture with the camera, or by adding a picture from their photo library.
